Our NFT holders are eligible to get whitelisted on the future projects and they can benefit the other projects' opportunities. If we shed some more light on the subject; for example: We are going to start creating a  Christmas project and both projects' holders will join the same DAO and we will keep growing as the seasons pass by.</RoadmapP>

            <RoadmapCard>
                <RoadmapP><br />Joint DAO:
                The reason of creating this DAO to make our seasonal NFT project holders to  interact with each other and to create a joint community that grows with every project as population and financially both. As the DAO community population keeps growing we will reach to more audience and we want to bring more people into Solana ecosystem and to our community. We are going to educate the people with no DAO experience & new comers all together and the experienced community members & most active members will get roles on the Joint DAO to carry the organisation even further on the Solana ecosystem. With this approach there's room for everybody to join & learn so we are not a community of one project but many.
                We’ve chosen to adopt the “Community-First” approach as laid out by Metacartel
                <br />Values;
